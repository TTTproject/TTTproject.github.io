Guys i complete the navbar, now is completely responsive and it works even on mobile. I test it on firefox. Maybe we gotta try
it on another browser. Is it possible to change colors if you prefere some.

I think it might also be possible write some css to decorate the window that appears on clicking the change document 
and change style buttons.

TODO:

1) link all the pages
2) test the files

OPTIONAL

1) MOVE THE NAVBAR ON A SPECIFIC FILE AND LOAD IT DINAMICALLY WITH JS

since now i think there is just js todo.


For Davide: how is it going with @media queries? 

I found really useful use the developer console in the browser i post you a screenshot.
It make you modify the window and tells you the size (width) of the page.

Anycase i can help you when i have some times :)

Waiting for your news bye!!

Thank you Christian
I am still working with the @media. I will keep working on them 
and I hope to make some improvement. I think today's situation is  
slightly better than yesterday's. We'll see tomorrow.

Anything you have can be helpful! I cannot see the screenshot
you mentioned, where can I find the developer console you're 
talking about?
